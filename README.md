**SDE II @ Amazon | Architect of Quiet Power | Ready for More**

---

### Summary

I write systems like others write poetry — with structure, soul, and zero tolerance for bloat.  
Currently an SDE II at Amazon, but titles don’t impress me — only impact does.  
I’ve architected POS platforms from the ground up, debugged biometric SDKs without hardware, built semantic ML pipelines under pressure, and cleaned up messes others were too scared to touch.

I don’t just “get the job done.” I see patterns, cut dead weight, and build forward. I leave systems better than I found them, even if it means rewriting what was never questioned.

I’m not looking for another job. I’m looking for a fight worth joining, a product that means something, and a team that wants a builder — not a resume.

### Core Tech

Java, Spring Boot, Python, AWS (Bedrock, Lambda, EC2, DynamoDB),  
Docker, SQL (Postgres, SQL Server), Git, Linux, Selenium, Puppeteer,  
Terraform, Kafka, REST/GraphQL

### What I’ve Built

**POS Backend API** 
Architected and delivered a multi-tenant restaurant POS backend using Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL — including schema migration, table layout logic, employee access, and Flutter frontend. Built from scratch, deployed with precision.

**Upwork Invoice Bot** 
Selenium + Puppeteer + Spring Boot — an automated system to fetch, archive, and filter Upwork invoices, freeing devs from repetitive admin.

**Internal Amazon service** 
Enhanced test coverage to 100%, mocked Bedrock APIs with CloudWatch metrics, rewrote brittle ML-integration logic in Python for reliability under pressure.

**Amazon Internal** 
Delivered GenAI-powered internal tools, resolved complex Bedrock upgrade issues under high-security constraints, and drove product-assistive search initiatives.

**Expedia Site Resolution API** 
Built and maintained a translation/resolution API to localize POS for international customers. Integrated EDI-based trip notification system. Enhanced date/time formatting across JVM services using icu4j.

**Expedia DevOps Tooling** 
Automated shared library releases, saving 8+ developer hours per week. Built Dropwizard & Spring Boot integration templates, refactored legacy codebases using a custom dead code analyzer.

**Expedia Transit Library** 
Contributed to a communication layer isolating application logic from external systems. Key in stabilizing services affected by thread spikes and memory leaks.

**ESLFaceIT Integration Platform** 
Automated offboarding processes by integrating HRIS, Active Directory, and access control systems — streamlining compliance and reducing manual effort across departments.

**Delivery Hero Platform Services** 
Owned full lifecycle dev. Actively partnered with product, coached juniors, and improved delivery pipelines via TDD and lean process thinking.

**Atypon / Heliyon CMS** 
Worked on journal publication flows, contributed to content delivery modules, and engaged in agile cycles with editorial and publishing teams.### What I’ve Built

### What I Believe

Complexity isn’t a sign of intelligence. Clarity is.  
Great code reflects the soul of the person behind it.  
Titles are temporary. Style is forever.  
I’d rather build for 100 people who truly care, than for 10 million who don’t.
